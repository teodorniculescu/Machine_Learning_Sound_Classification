# Machine Learning Sound Classification in MATLAB

The Machine Learning classifier was trained using the sounds from the [ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification](https://www.karolpiczak.com/papers/Piczak2015-ESC-Dataset.pdf).

The features extracted from the sounds are mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and the zero-crossing rate. A good explanation for extracting MFCC can be found [here](http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/).
